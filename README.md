# CodeForge: Custom Contest & Analytics Platform

## Project Title
**CodeForge: Custom Contest Platform with Codeforces Integration**

_CodeForge_ is a web application that enables competitive programmers to host and participate in custom contests while leveraging data from Codeforces. The platform offers a comprehensive set of features for contest creation, team participation, performance tracking, and personalized problem recommendations.

## Features Implemented
- **User Login & Verification:**  
  Users log in using their Codeforces username. A unique challenge is issuedâ€”users must submit a compilation error within 120 seconds to verify ownership.

- **Announcements & Comments:**  
  Post announcements and comments that are displayed on the home page.

- **Friend System**  
  Search for any Codeforces profile, add them to your friend list.

- **Custom Contest Creation:**  
  Create custom contests by setting the contest name, start time, and duration. Administrators can add problems manually (via URL) or choose random problems based on a specified rating. A unique contest code is generated for inviting friends.

- **Contest Participation:**  
  Join contests either individually or as a team (up to 3 members per team). If you participate as part of a team, your individual entry is hidden from the leaderboard.

- **ICPC-Style Leaderboard:**  
  View contest standings with an interactive leaderboard that follows ICPC scoring (solved problems and penalty time), complete with a Codeforces-like interface.
